Welcome to Problem Set 1!

The full information for this problem set is available at https://web.mit.edu/6.102/www/sp24/psets/ps1/#specifications

Here's your starting project structure and code. Follow these steps to get set up and begin working on the problem set:

- Run npm install: Open a terminal, navigate to your PS1 directory, and run npm install. This will install all the necessary packages for the project.

- Open in VS Code: Open the ITSEPC-Problem-sets folder in VS Code where you also have PS1 folder.

- Explore the Files: Take a look at the generated files:

  - src/algorithm.ts: This is where you will implement the flashcard algorithm functions. Read the TypeDoc comments for each function to understand their specifications.

  - test/algorithmTest.ts: This is where you will write your Mocha tests for the functions in algorithm.ts.

  - src/utils.ts & test/utilsTest.ts: These are for optional utility functions and their tests. You likely won't need them for PS1 initially, but they are there for good practice.

  - flashcards.ts: DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE. It defines the Flashcard, AnswerDifficulty, and BucketMap types that you will use throughout the problem set.

Start with algorithm.ts and test/algorithmTest.ts:

- Read the Specifications: Carefully read the TypeDoc comments in src/algorithm.ts to understand the specifications of each function.

- Write Tests First: Open test/algorithmTest.ts and start writing your Mocha tests before implementing any of the functions. Use the provided describe and it blocks as a starting point. Remember to write your testing strategy as a comment at the top of the file.

- Implement Iteratively: Implement the functions one by one, starting with toBucketSets and getBucketRange. Follow the test-first programming workflow: Spec -> Test -> Implement -> Commit.

- Run Tests Frequently: Use npm test in the terminal to run your tests and see your progress.

- Commit and Push Regularly: Use git add, git commit, and git push to save your work frequently to Git.
